## Problem Statements Solved with Steps

### 1. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
   **Objective:** Calculate and display Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Quantity, Number of Orders, and Profit Margin dynamically.

   **Steps:**
   1. Import the **Orders Table** into Excel using Power Query.
   2. Create calculated columns for:

   3. Use Excel formulas to calculate:
      - Total Sales = =SUM(Sales).
      - Total Profit = =SUM(Profit).
      - Total Quantity = =SUM(Quantity).
   4. Build a dynamic KPI table and use symbols to enhance visual appeal (e.g., ðŸ’° for Total Sales).
